# ProjectBricks

A game based on an old Flash game I played about 15 years ago.

Try to remove all the bricks!

Clicking a brick will highlight all the neighbouring bricks that will be removed when clicking the brick again.  
Bricks can only be removed if 2 or more of the same colour are highlighted.  
You can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel and pan by dragging with the left mouse button.
